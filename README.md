# InspectoRepo

A local web application that analyzes TypeScript + React codebases and produces structured code review suggestions with a VSCode-like interface.

## Why

Manual code review is time-consuming and inconsistent. InspectoRepo provides deterministic, AST-based analysis of TS/TSX files — surfacing real improvement opportunities with proposed diffs, all running locally with zero dependencies on paid APIs.

## Key Features (V1)

- **Folder selection** — pick a local codebase using File System Access API (Chrome/Edge) with a fallback `<input webkitdirectory>` upload
- **Directory tree** — browse top-level directories with checkboxes; defaults to `src/` if present
- **TS/TSX analysis engine** — deterministic pipeline: scan → parse (ts-morph in-memory) → apply rules → score → report
- **Issue list UI** — filterable by severity/search, with expandable issue rows showing full details, severity color-coded borders, and clickable file paths with line numbers
- **Preview status** — the web UI displays a Preview badge indicating the product is under active development
- **Scoring** — 0–100 score based on issue severity counts
- **Markdown export** — download a full analysis report as `.md`
- **Exclude rules** — automatically skips `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, hidden dirs, and other noise
- **Monorepo architecture** — npm workspaces with `shared`, `core`, and `web` packages
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions running lint, typecheck, build, and test on every push/PR, plus automated InspectoRepo analysis on pull requests

## Implemented Rules

| Rule | Severity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `unused-imports` | warn | Detects unused import specifiers (default, namespace, named) and suggests removal with a safe proposed patch |
| `complexity-hotspot` | warn | Flags functions with high cyclomatic-like complexity (≥ 12) with specific contributor breakdown (nested conditionals, loops, ternaries, logical chains) and tailored suggestions |
| `optional-chaining` | info | Detects monotonic guard chains like `a && a.b && a.b.c` and suggests optional chaining (`a?.b?.c`) |
| `boolean-simplification` | info | Simplifies `x === true`, `x === false`, `!!x`, and `x ? true : false` patterns |
| `early-return` | info | Detects unnecessary block-style early returns and suggests single-line guard clauses |
| `no-debugger` | warn | Detects `debugger` statements left in code — auto-fixable |
| `no-empty-catch` | warn | Flags empty catch blocks that silently hide errors — report only |
| `no-useless-return` | info | Detects redundant `return;` at the end of functions — auto-fixable |
| `ts-diagnostics` | error | Reports high-confidence TypeScript compiler diagnostics (unreachable code, duplicate identifiers, missing names, type mismatches) — report only |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Run checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

## Scripts

| Script                | Description                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`         | Start Vite dev server        |
| `npm run build`       | Build all packages + web app |
| `npm run lint`        | Lint all TS/TSX files        |
| `npm run typecheck`   | TypeScript type checking     |
| `npm run format`      | Format with Prettier         |
| `npm run format:check`| Check formatting             |
| `npm test`            | Run Vitest tests             |
| `npm run repopack`   | Generate repomix exports     |

> **Export packs:** `npm run repopack` generates four versioned files under `ai/exports/`. Use `repo-pack-latest-vN.md` for a quick lightweight review — it includes project structure and core source without docs, screenshots, or scripts.

## Demo

Try InspectoRepo locally in three steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wai-coding/inspectorepo.git
   cd inspectorepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server and analyze a folder**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open the URL shown in the terminal. Click **Select Folder** (Chrome/Edge) or **Upload Folder** (any browser) to load a TypeScript project. Use the sidebar checkboxes to pick directories, then click **Analyze**. View issues in the main panel, click any issue to see details and proposed fixes, and click **Export .md** to download a Markdown report.

   > **Browser support:** The folder picker uses the File System Access API (Chrome/Edge). Other browsers can use the Upload Folder fallback.

## CLI

Analyze any TypeScript project from the terminal:

```bash
# Basic analysis (markdown report to stdout)
inspectorepo analyze ./my-project

# Analyze specific directories with markdown output
inspectorepo analyze ./my-project --dirs src --format md

# JSON output
inspectorepo analyze ./my-project --format json

# Write report to file
npx inspectorepo analyze ./my-project --out report.md

# Limit issues and select specific directories
npx inspectorepo analyze ./my-project --dirs src,lib --max-issues 10
```

### CLI Fix

Apply safe code fixes interactively:

```bash
inspectorepo fix ./my-project
```

The fix command runs analysis, finds issues with safe auto-fix suggestions, shows a preview of each proposed change, and asks for confirmation before applying. Rules with auto-fix support: `optional-chaining`, `boolean-simplification`, `unused-imports`, `early-return`, `no-debugger`, and `no-useless-return`. Advisory rules like `complexity-hotspot`, `no-empty-catch`, and `ts-diagnostics` are never auto-applied.

### Fix Preview Mode

Preview all proposed fixes without modifying any files:

```bash
inspectorepo fix ./my-project --preview
```

Example output:

```
Proposed fixes:

File: src/user.ts
Rule: optional-chaining

  Before:
  if (user && user.name)

  After:
  if (user?.name)

---

1 fixable issue(s) found. No files were modified.
```

Preview mode is useful for dry-run checks in CI or for reviewing all changes before committing to apply them.

Example interactive output:

```
Rule: optional-chaining

File: src/user.ts
Line: 42

Before:
user && user.profile && user.profile.name

After:
user?.profile?.name

Suggested diff:
  - user && user.profile && user.profile.name
  + user?.profile?.name

Apply fix? (y/N)
```

The CLI uses the same analysis engine as the web UI. Output is deterministic — same input always produces the same report.

## Rules

| Rule | Severity | Auto-fix | Description |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `unused-imports` | warn | ✅ | Detects unused import specifiers and suggests removal |
| `complexity-hotspot` | warn | ❌ | Flags high-complexity functions with specific contributor breakdown and tailored suggestions |
| `optional-chaining` | info | ✅ | Suggests `?.` for monotonic guard chains |
| `boolean-simplification` | info | ✅ | Simplifies redundant boolean expressions |
| `early-return` | info | ✅ | Detects unnecessary block-style early returns |
| `no-debugger` | warn | ✅ | Detects `debugger` statements left in code |
| `no-empty-catch` | warn | ❌ | Flags empty catch blocks that silently hide errors |
| `no-useless-return` | info | ✅ | Detects redundant `return;` at the end of functions |
| `ts-diagnostics` | error | ❌ | Reports high-confidence TypeScript compiler diagnostics |

## Configuration

Create `.inspectorepo.json` in your project root to configure which rules run and their severity:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "optional-chaining": "error",
    "unused-imports": "warn",
    "complexity-hotspot": "off",
    "boolean-simplification": "warn",
    "early-return": "warn",
    "no-debugger": "warn",
    "no-empty-catch": "warn",
    "no-useless-return": "warn",
    "ts-diagnostics": "off"
  }
}
```

### Rule Presets

Use a preset for a curated default configuration:

```json
{
  "preset": "recommended"
}
```

Available presets:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `recommended` | Balanced defaults — all rules at `warn` |
| `strict` | Stricter — `unused-imports` and `complexity-hotspot` at `error` |
| `cleanup` | Style-focused — disables `complexity-hotspot`, keeps simplification rules |
| `react` | React/TS projects — `unused-imports` at `error`, all others `warn` |

Explicit rule config overrides preset values:

```json
{
  "preset": "strict",
  "rules": {
    "complexity-hotspot": "off"
  }
}
```

CLI preset override:

```bash
inspectorepo analyze ./my-project --preset strict
```

Severity levels:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `error` | Run with high severity |
| `warn` | Run with default severity |
| `off` | Disabled |

Override from CLI with the `--rules` flag:

```bash
inspectorepo analyze ./my-project --rules optional-chaining,unused-imports
```

When `--rules` is provided, only those rules run (config file is ignored).

## Ignore File

Create `.inspectorepoignore` in your project root to exclude files and directories from analysis:

```
dist
build
node_modules
coverage
tests
```

Supports simple `.inspectorepoignore` patterns (directory names and basic `*.ext` matches). Each line matches a path segment or filename wildcard. The ignore file is automatically respected by the CLI.

## Interface Preview

![InspectoRepo UI](./screenshots/ui-layout.png)

> Dark VSCode-like interface with file tree sidebar, issues list in the main panel, and detail/diff view on the right.

## Sample Output

See [examples/sample-report.md](./examples/sample-report.md) for a full analysis report generated from the [fixture repo](./examples/fixture-repo/). This shows the exact Markdown output InspectoRepo produces, including severity emojis, issue tables, and collapsible proposed diffs.

## VS Code Extension

InspectoRepo can run directly inside VS Code. The extension registers a command that invokes the CLI on the current workspace and generates a Markdown report.

1. Open a workspace folder in VS Code
2. Run the command **InspectoRepo: Run Analysis** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. A report (`inspectorepo-vscode-report.md`) is generated in the workspace root

The extension uses the same analysis engine as the CLI and web UI.

## GitHub Action

InspectoRepo runs automatically on every pull request via the `.github/workflows/inspectorepo-analysis.yml` workflow. It can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`. Steps:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Node.js 20
3. Installs dependencies and builds all packages
4. Runs the analysis:
   ```bash
   node packages/cli/dist/index.js analyze . --dirs packages,apps --format md --out inspectorepo-report.md
   ```
5. Uploads `inspectorepo-report.md` as a build artifact (retained 30 days)
6. Posts a concise analysis summary comment on the pull request (score, issue counts, severity breakdown) — updates the same comment on subsequent runs to avoid noise

Download the `inspectorepo-report` artifact from the Actions tab to see the full analysis.

## Deployment Readiness

The InspectoRepo web UI is currently in **Preview**. It is stable enough for local experimentation and demo purposes but is not yet deployed as a hosted service.

- **Browser support:** The folder picker requires the File System Access API (Chrome or Edge). Other browsers can use the Upload Folder fallback or the "Try with sample project" button.
- **Onboarding:** The app shows a clear About section explaining how to run an analysis, with browser capability detection and a sample project for instant exploration.
- **Empty state:** When no issues are found, the UI displays a friendly confirmation with the analysis score.
- **Preview badge:** A visible "Preview" badge in the top bar signals the product is under active development.

For production deployment, the web app is a standard Vite/React build (`npm run build`) and can be served from any static hosting provider.

## Custom Rule API

Extend InspectoRepo with your own rules using `defineRule()`:

```ts
import { analyzeCodebase, defineRule } from '@inspectorepo/core';

const noConsoleRule = defineRule({
  id: 'no-console',
  title: 'No Console',
  severity: 'warn',
  run(ctx) {
    const issues = [];
    ctx.sourceFile.getDescendantsOfKind(SyntaxKind.CallExpression).forEach((call) => {
      if (/^console\.\w+$/.test(call.getExpression().getText())) {
        issues.push({
          id: `${ctx.filePath}:${call.getStartLineNumber()}:no-console`,
          ruleId: 'no-console',
          severity: 'warn',
          message: `Unexpected ${call.getExpression().getText()} statement`,
          filePath: ctx.filePath,
          range: { start: { line: call.getStartLineNumber(), column: 1 }, end: { line: call.getStartLineNumber(), column: 1 } },
          suggestion: { summary: 'Remove console statement', details: '' },
        });
      }
    });
    return issues;
  },
});

const report = analyzeCodebase({
  files,
  selectedDirectories: ['src'],
  options: { customRules: [noConsoleRule] },
});
```

Custom rules run alongside built-in rules. Pass them via `options.customRules` — no plugin loading or npm packages required. See [examples/custom-rule-no-console.ts](./examples/custom-rule-no-console.ts) for a complete example.

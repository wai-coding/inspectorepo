## 2026-03-05 — Bootstrap Monorepo

### What was implemented

- Initialized git repo with `main` and `dev` branches
- Created AI control files (`ai/prompt-master.md`, `ai/project-context.md`)
- Set up npm workspaces monorepo with three packages:
  - `apps/web` — Vite + React + TypeScript frontend
  - `packages/core` — Analysis engine with scanner, analyzer, rule interface
  - `packages/shared` — Shared types (Issue, AnalysisResult, AnalysisReport)
- Configured tooling: ESLint (flat config), Prettier, Vitest, TypeScript project references
- Built a minimal VSCode-like dark UI layout (TopBar, Sidebar, MainPanel, DetailsPanel)
- Wrote initial tests for scanner and analyzer (7 tests, all passing)

### Why

Foundation for the entire InspectoRepo project. The monorepo structure keeps analysis logic separate from the UI, making it testable and reusable (e.g., future CLI package).

### How to run/test

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Start web app
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript
npm run build      # Build all packages
npm test           # Run Vitest
```

### Design decisions

- **npm workspaces** over Turborepo/Nx — minimal complexity for a small project
- **TypeScript project references** (`tsc -b`) — proper incremental builds across packages
- **Flat ESLint config** — modern approach, no `.eslintrc` files
- **VSCode-like dark theme** — professional look matching the target audience (developers/recruiters)
- **Placeholder rule** — returns zero issues; demonstrates the Rule interface contract without implementing logic yet

## 2026-03-05 — M1: Stable Scripts & Formatting

### What was implemented
- Added Prettier format scripts (`npm run format`, `npm run format:check`)
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings
- Added `.prettierignore` to skip generated files
- Ran Prettier across all files for consistent formatting
- Updated README with new scripts

### Why
M1 goal: stable, reproducible scripts with consistent formatting. All four checks (lint, typecheck, build, test) pass cleanly.

### How to verify
```bash
npm run lint        # zero errors
npm run typecheck   # zero errors
npm run build       # all packages + web build successfully
npm test            # 7 tests pass
npm run format:check # all files formatted
```
